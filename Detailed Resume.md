## Professional Summary
I am a highly motivated individual who is looking to start a career in software development/engineering. I have a solid foundation in chemical/mechanical engineering experience (about 7 years between college and working experience), and over the last 6 months I have been, and continue to be, working hard to train myself in software development (in addition to my hobbyist efforts for most of my life). I am confident that with my combined skill set and experience that I will make a valuable addition to any team and look forward to gaining professional experience in software development.

I've decided to make the change to software development as a personal choice this last year. I have always had a passion for software and computer technology and recently realized that it is more appealing to me now than traditional engineering ever was. In a nutshell, I am making the change because I love making software!

I am predominately looking for work in Ohio, the closer to Cleveland the better, since I have family in the Cleveland area and simply like the area too. However, I am open to discussing relocation to other places for work instead if the opportunity is a good fit for me. I am also open to remote positions and can facilitate periodic travel (i.e. by flight or road trip) to meet in person.

Please continue reading for an overview of my experience and skills. Also keep in mind that I continue to work at improving my skills in software development weekly and I intend to update my resume regularly to reflect my progress.
### A Note about Working Hours:
I would like to be up front and specific about working hours: I do not want to work more than 40 hours a week and will try to keep to a tight schedule. I have responsibilities outside of work that demand my time and attention, so I cannot commit to 50+ hours of work in a week. I can facilitate travel for work as long as I am given opportunity to plan around it. If the position you are looking to fill requires periodic compensated overtime, I am open to discuss it.
## College and Training
### Undergraduate College
Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI

BS Chemical Engineering, 3.62 GPA (Cum Laude), April 2016

Passed FE Exam, April 2016
#### Comments:
Curriculum focused on a wide array of technical subjects including topics of physics, thermodynamics, chemistry, heat and mass transfer modeling, process modeling, and a variety of practical labs. 

Also included introductory classes for programming (C++) and electrical circuit design.

### Our Community Listens communication training, provided by PhillipsLISTENS, INC, November 2016
This training was one of the most eye opening experiences of my life. It built on top of all of the communications courses I took in college and taught me very powerful ways to communicate and cooperate with others. This course forms the foundation of how I communicate with others now, and has proven very effective, especially in my time at DTE. 

### Continuous Improvement Program Training, DTE Energy, 2018-2019
DTE has implemented an internal Continuous Improvement (CI) program and standardized it enterprise-wide. Most of my work processes at DTE were derived from CI activities and efforts to improve the efficiency and reliability of the organization. DTE also provided in-class training courses on CI concepts and methodology, which I took. CI as it is implemented by DTE is similar to Six Sigma and similar programs, but is a unique program tailored to the specific needs of DTE.
## Work Experience
### Natural Gas Transmission Pipeline and Facilities Engineer, DTE Energy, Detroit, MI 2017-2020
My primary function within this position was to own, manage, and execute capital projects to install and modify natural gas transmission systems. The position covered a very broad array of auxiliary responsibilities, including support of other departments, records auditing, and coordinating with outside companies who are performing construction in the vicinity of DTE Gas facilities (facility requests). I also had many opportunities to contribute to my department's work processes and improve the overall function of the team.
#### Capital Project Execution
Completed 10's of capital projects per year. Most were small scale ($10,000 - $250,000), but regularly worked on mid scale ($250 - $500,000) projects and periodically worked on large scale ($500,000 - $1MM+) as well.
##### a. Engineering and Design
Responsible for end to end design of the new natural gas facilities for each project. Design process started with conceptual design, which captured the scope of the project, intended modifications, and equipment sizing. Ended with detailed design, which resulted in a complete set of engineer signed construction drawings, project documentation, and procurement of all materials and services required for the project.

##### b. Record Keeping and Documentation
Per federal regulatory requirements, assembled complete documentation of each project's scope and construction records. Also personally co-led my department's response to a records audit requested by the Michigan Public Safety Commission (MPSC), which involved finding, understanding, and presenting project construction records for projects executed over the last 40 years.

##### c. Financial Analysis
Created detailed cost estimates for every assigned project. Performed financial forecasting for each project at regular intervals during the annual project cycle. Measured cost variance between cost estimates and actual project costs and used the data to improve future cost estimating.

##### d. Collaboration and Coordination
The execution of every project required collaboration between 5-10 internal departments, and as the engineer it was my responsibility to inform and coordinate activities between all of the departments. Inter-department collaboration was required for everything from initial planning and design to implementation and construction of each project. 

I was also responsible for coordinating with external vendors and contractors to provide the required materials and services to complete the project within the project's timeframe.

While the project engineer does not directly oversee construction on any project, the engineer was also responsible for coordinating construction activities between the required groups (i.e. internal/external mechanical, electrical, and civil construction crews).

##### e. Procurement of Materials and services
As the project engineer, I was responsible for developing material specifications and service scope of work documents, and reaching out to vendors and contractors (either directly or through Procurement) to request quotes and bids. Also performed bid analysis and selection on received bids. 

Developed and maintained business relationships between myself and vendors/contractors, and worked closely with many throughout my time at DTE. I and my team also received a variety of training on specialized topics from our vendors and contractors.

#### Facility Requests
One of the main auxiliary functions of the engineers at DTE was to respond to facility requests. A facility request is when an outside organization is planning to build over or around a DTE gas line and notifies DTE (normally) through the MISS DIG system. This triggers a process where DTE must review the client's construction plans and provide guidance to the client regarding how to safely build around the pipeline. During the review process, the engineer becomes the primary point of contact for the engineer, and it is the engineer's responsibility to reach out to them and collect all the necessary information on the project.

After my initial successes with facility requests, I quickly became one of the go-to people for handling facility requests within my team. This was actually one of the most interesting parts of my job, since each client's scenario was unique and usually required a custom solution devised in collaboration between myself and the client. Additionally, these jobs required a large amount of relationship building and conflict resolution, since the interests of the client often conflicted hard with the interests of DTE (which are grounded in public safety, pipeline maintenance, and cost effectiveness).

I am pleased to say that I was very successful in my assigned facility requests, and managed to make successes out of ones that started off terribly sticky.
