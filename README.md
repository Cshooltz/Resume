# Resume
Welcome! This repository acts as my public profile for details on my work experience and skills. I am currently looking for employment as a software developer/engineer. I previously worked at a natural gas pipeline engineer, but since then I have decided to pursue a career in software development instead. If you would like to contact me, please do so through GitHub or Indeed.

For a brief summary of my skills and experience, please visit [Brief Resume.md](Brief%20Resume.md).

If you would like additional details and background on my skills and experience, please visit [Detailed Resume.md](Detailed%20Resume.md).

For specific details regarding my software projects, please see my other GitHub repositories.

Finally, you may also view my Indeed profile here: [my.indeed.com/p/collins-unfknif](https://my.indeed.com/p/collins-unfknif),  
which contains largely the same information, but is a good place to contact me.

Thank you,

\- Collin Shooltz
